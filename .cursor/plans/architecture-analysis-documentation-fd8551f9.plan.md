# Comprehensive Architecture Analysis & Documentation

## Overview

Analyze and document the complete current architecture of django-bulk-triggers after the mixin-to-services refactoring, identifying what's implemented, how components interact, and what gaps remain.

## 1. Architecture Overview Section

Document the high-level architecture:

- Current design pattern (Service-based composition)
- Layer separation (Facade → Coordinator → Services → ORM)
- Design principles applied (SOLID, separation of concerns)
- Key architectural decisions and rationale

**Files to analyze:**

- `django_bulk_triggers/queryset.py` - Facade layer
- `django_bulk_triggers/operations/coordinator.py` - Orchestration layer
- All files in `django_bulk_triggers/operations/` - Service layer

## 2. Component Inventory

Catalog all components with:

- Component name and location
- Responsibility/purpose
- Dependencies (what it uses)
- Public API methods
- Lines of code
- Completeness status

**Core Components:**

1. `TriggerQuerySet` (queryset.py) - Django API facade
2. `BulkOperationCoordinator` (operations/coordinator.py) - Service orchestrator
3. `ModelAnalyzer` (operations/analyzer.py) - Validation and field analysis
4. `BulkExecutor` (operations/bulk_executor.py) - Database operations
5. `MTIHandler` (operations/mti_handler.py) - Multi-table inheritance
6. `TriggerDispatcher` (dispatcher.py) - Trigger lifecycle management
7. `ChangeSet/RecordChange` (changeset.py) - Data transfer objects
8. `BulkTriggerManager` (manager.py) - Django Manager integration
9. `TriggerModelMixin` (models.py) - Model integration
10. Supporting: factory.py, conditions.py, handler.py, registry.py, context.py, etc.

## 3. Data Flow Documentation

Map the complete flow for each operation:

- `bulk_create()` flow with all steps
- `bulk_update()` flow with all steps  
- `update()` (QuerySet update) flow with all steps
- `delete()` flow with all steps
- `bulk_delete()` flow with all steps

Show:

- Entry point → Exit point
- Service calls at each step
- Trigger phases (VALIDATE → BEFORE → OPERATION → AFTER)
- Data transformations (objects → ChangeSet → triggers → DB)

## 4. Service Dependency Graph

Document explicit dependencies:

- What depends on what
- Dependency injection patterns used
- Lazy initialization vs eager initialization
- Circular dependency handling (if any)

Create a visual representation showing:

```
TriggerQuerySet
    ↓ (lazy property)
BulkOperationCoordinator
    ↓ (lazy properties)
├─ ModelAnalyzer
├─ MTIHandler  
├─ BulkExecutor (depends on: ModelAnalyzer, MTIHandler)
└─ TriggerDispatcher
```

## 5. Test Coverage Analysis

Analyze current test state:

- Total tests: 366 collected
- Passing: ~326 (89.3%)
- Failing: ~39 (10.7%)
- Skipped: 2

**Categorize failing tests by area:**

- Engine tests (deprecated `engine.run()` usage)
- Integration tests (workflow issues)
- MTI tests (save/delete equivalence)
- Upsert tests (update_conflicts logic)
- QuerySet extended tests (internal API changes)
- Subquery tests (data access in triggers)

**Test file inventory:**

- List all test files with their focus area
- Note which test old vs new architecture
- Identify coverage gaps

## 6. Completeness Assessment

For each major feature area, document status:

**Bulk Operations:**

- bulk_create: Status, known issues
- bulk_update: Status, known issues
- update (queryset): Status, known issues
- delete: Status, known issues
- bulk_delete: Status, known issues

**Trigger System:**

- Trigger registration: Complete/Incomplete
- Trigger execution: Complete/Incomplete
- Condition filtering: Complete/Incomplete
- Priority ordering: Complete/Incomplete
- Nested triggers: Complete/Incomplete
- Recursion prevention: Complete/Incomplete

**Multi-Table Inheritance:**

- MTI detection: Complete/Incomplete
- Parent table operations: Complete/Incomplete
- Child table operations: Complete/Incomplete
- Deep inheritance: Complete/Incomplete

**Advanced Features:**

- Upsert (update_conflicts): Complete/Incomplete
- Batch processing: Complete/Incomplete
- Transaction handling: Complete/Incomplete
- Context bypass: Complete/Incomplete
- Subquery support: Complete/Incomplete

## 7. Known Issues & Gaps

Document specific problems:

- List of 39 failing tests with root causes
- Missing functionality from old architecture
- Performance concerns
- Edge cases not handled
- Database compatibility issues

Group by:

1. Critical (breaks core functionality)
2. Important (affects advanced features)
3. Minor (edge cases, optimizations)

## 8. Code Metrics

Quantify the architecture:

- Total lines of code by layer
- Lines per component (service classes)
- Cyclomatic complexity indicators
- Before vs After refactoring metrics
- Files removed during cleanup

## 9. Migration Status

Document the refactoring journey:

- What was removed (5 mixin files, 3 test files)
- What was consolidated (Validator + FieldTracker → ModelAnalyzer)
- What was created (new service layer)
- Import/export changes
- Breaking changes (internal APIs only)

## 10. Production Readiness Assessment

Evaluate for production use:

- Backward compatibility: 100% for public API
- Test coverage: 89.3% passing
- Performance: Comparison vs old architecture
- Documentation: Current state
- Known blockers for production

**Output Format:**

Create a new markdown file: `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` with all sections above, using code examples, diagrams (text-based), and specific file/line references.
